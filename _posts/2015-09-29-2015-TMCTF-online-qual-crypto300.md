title: TMCTF Qualification Round 2015 - Crypto 300
---

Description for this challenge was:

```
What is the most famous default password of "keystore"?
```

along with the provided password protected file *level1.zip*.

Googling for *famous default password keystore* gave us the following entry at the first page of results:

```
Setting a Keystore Password - JXplorer (jxplorer.org/help/Setting_a_Keystore_Password.htm)

The cacerts keystore file has a default password of changeit; the clientcerts keystore file has a default password of passphrase. This option allows you to set a ...
```


Trying to open the password protected file *level1.zip* with the password *changeit* was a success. Inside of it there were three files:

```
level2.file.encrypted
level2.key.encrypted
Readme.txt
```

Content of file *Readme.txt* was as follows:

```
Welcome to the published key quest!
Your Quest is to find the published key!
 
You have a encrypted file and a encrypted key.
 - levelX.file.encrypted
 - levelX.key.encrypted
 
If you can find the key for decrypting "levelX.key.encrypted", then you can decrypt the file.
 
We encrypted the file using the following command.
>openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -base64 -in ./levelX+1.zip -out levelX.file.encrypted -pass file:./levelX.key
 
We also encrypted the key using the following command.
>openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey ThePublishedPublicKey.pem -pubin -in levelX.key | openssl base64 >levelX.key.encrypted
 
If you can decrypt "levelX.file.encrypted", you can get a next level zip file.
All zip files are encrypted by the level 1 quest's answer.
 
========================================================================
Level 2 quest's hint :
The key of the most famous "Snakeoil" CA.
========================================================================
 
Have fun!
```

Googling for *Snakeoil CA ext:key* resulted with the following entry at the first page:

```
libapache-mod-ssl/snakeoil-ca-rsa.key at master ... - GitHub (https://github.com/...mod-ssl/.../snakeoil-ca-rsa.key)

Contribute to libapache-mod-ssl development by creating an account on GitHub.
```

Using that same file to decrypt the Level2 files produced the following results:

```

```

Unzipping the *level2.zip* with the (reused) password *changeit* resulted with the following three files:

```
level3.file.encrypted
level3.key.encrypted
Readme.txt
```

Content of `Readme.txt` was as follows:

Level 3 quest's hint :
 -This RSA key is intended for testing the most popular packet analyzer.
 -Prime1 < Prime2
========================================================================

Have fun!
```

By visiting the (*most popular packet analyzer*) Wireshark's Github repository ([https://github.com/wireshark/wireshark](https://github.com/wireshark/wireshark)), we found the following files inside the directory */test/keys*:

```
dhe1_keylog.dat     add a test for SSL/TLS decryption using the master secret
key.p12     SSL: Add support for private key password when decrypting
rsa-p-lt-q.key  ssl-utils: fix failing decryption for some RSA keys
rsasnakeoil2.key    Remove svn:executable attribute.
snakeoil-rsa.key    Add a test for DTLS decryption.
```

As the hint says *Prime1 < Prime2* by using the *rsa-p-lt-q.key* we got the following results:

```

Unzipping the `level3.zip` with the (reused) password `changeit` resulted with the following three files:

level4.key.encrypted

Content of `Readme.txt` was as follows:

========================================================================
Level 4 quest's hint :
 -This RSA key is intended for testing the most famous implementation of Python.
 -This published key is password-encrypted, and you may also have to find the password.

Have fun!
```

By visiting the (*most famous implementation of Python*) CPython's Github repository ([https://github.com/python/cpython](https://github.com/python/cpython)), we found the file *ssl_key.pem* inside the directory */Lib/test*. Using it we got the following results:

Level 5 quest's hint :
The key is one of the keys related to a famous vulnerable random generator.

```

By Googling for *famous vulnerable random generator* we've seen that there are references to the *Debian OpenSSL Bug*. Hence, by Googling for *Debian OpenSSL keys* we were being brought to the *Debian OpenSSL Predictable PRNG* Github repository ([https://github.com/g0tmi1k/debian-ssh](https://github.com/g0tmi1k/debian-ssh)). By using its collection of *predictable* SSH/RSA private keys in a brute-force manner we got the following results:

Hence, the final flag was:
